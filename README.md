# Welcome to My GitHub! üë©‚Äçüíª

I‚Äôm **Maria Akter Mukti**, a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student at **United International University (UIU)**, currently in my 4th trimester.  

I am deeply passionate about programming and problem-solving, with hands-on experience in platforms like **Codeforces**, **CodeChef**, and **HackerRank**. These experiences have helped me strengthen my algorithmic thinking and logical reasoning skills.  

In addition to competitive programming, I have a solid foundation in **HTML** and **CSS**, and I am exploring emerging fields such as **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **App Development**. My goal is to utilize these technologies to solve real-world problems and drive innovation.

Feel free to explore my repositories or connect with me to collaborate on exciting projects. Let‚Äôs build something amazing together!
